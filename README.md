On the client side there are [forge-base](https://github.com/ogrebgr/forge), [forge-android](https://github.com/ogrebgr/forge-android) and [forge-android-skeleton-basic](https://github.com/ogrebgr/forge-android-skeleton-basic) and on the server side there are [forge-server](https://github.com/ogrebgr/forge-server) and [forge-server-skeleton](https://github.com/ogrebgr/forge-serverskeleton).
